# IntegrityVault
My custom tool to keep files safe! Generates unique 20-char hashes using a key, salt, and time. Tested on Kali Linux.
We generate basic hash with SHA-256. Folder scanning feature is available. Salt, timestamp, key are added. We add an easier interface for you as GUI (using Tkinter). It has SHA-256 (256-bit) + customization algorithm. It is user-friendly.
